			<h2>Can I request changes to a drink?</h2>
			<p>Though we make a point to be as open and accomodating to our cherished 
			   customers as possible, we do have some limitations as to drink requests.
			   You can always request the amount of pulp/seeds/chunks in a drink, and some
			   ingredients can be replaced in case of allergies. However, some elements of our
			   drink are needed for an optimal drink and cannot be replaced.</p>

		<article id="coupons">
			<h2>Can I reuse my coupon?</h2>
			<p>Your coupons can be used at any location, and will not expire. However, those 
			   coupons are one-use only, and cannot be re-used. You can get a free coupon by signing
			   up to our mailing list <a href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>

			   formal balls. We will need at least three business day's worth of notice before an event,
			   and we reserve the right to refuse requests at our discretion. Last minute proposals

			<p>We've all seen how you tend to get drinks in most restaurants, right? Just pre-prepared
			empty calories from who-knows-what source, carelessly poured into a paper cup and served. We
			here at Jumpin' Juice Co, though, make sure that all our drinks are crafted in real time, 
			right in front of you! We strive to be as transparent as possible, and that extends to the 
			actual creation of our drinks too. Our employees take pride in their work, and you can be 
			sure to be impressed by their efficiency and flair while creating your beverage!</p>
